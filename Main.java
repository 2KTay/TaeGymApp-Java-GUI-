/*

Motivation:
I like going to the gym and would appreciate it if I had a program that organized my workouts. I
would waste less time and can use this on a real-life day-to-day basis. As a result, I can
accomplish my gym goals and submit this Final Project.


Description:
The Gym App is a Java program that allows users to organize 3 types of Gym. Hypertrophy,
Strength, and Power.
Users can put whatever workout is available on either Sunday, Monday,
